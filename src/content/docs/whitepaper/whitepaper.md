title: IClandlord whitepaper Alpha
description: A guide in iclandlord game.
---

The IClandlord Whitepaper is your guide to the future of on-chain gaming. It covers the project's mission, technical architecture, governance model, funding initiatives, growth strategy, and sustainability plans. The document also outlines the project's tokenomics, roadmap, and democratic governance.

## 1. Background

U.S. mobile gaming ad spending is expected to grow 10% to $6.28 billion in 2023, according to Emarketer. This momentum is expected to continue in the coming years, with growth rates fluctuating between 8% and 10%. As you can see, there is still a lot of room for casual games to grow in the future, while cryptocurrency games are just in their infancy, and we believe that the Landlord game will attract a lot of traditional gamers to join the cryptocurrency game ecosystem.

Why build on IC?

As a matter of fact, traditional games cannot achieve true randomization in terms of random numbers, which is often unfair to the players. Therefore, we want to build a full-chain game completely on IC, so as to achieve true fairness and openness. At the same time, most of L1 has high latency due to its consensus mechanism. Internet computer solves this problem through its chain key technology, which can make smart contracts run at high speed, theoretically as long as there are enough subnets and edge nodes can speed up the whole consensus mechanism, and ensure that the transaction is completed within 1-2 seconds.

At the same time, canister smart contracts can run in web pages and can be integrated with WebAssembly, enabling developers to utilize WebGL and WebGPU to serve their game clients directly from canister smart contracts. With this solution, ICs can perform full on-chain game interactions at lightning speed, which is a perfect solution to the serious problem of UI interactions and latency.

The IClandlord whitepaper is your guide to the IClandlord game. The whitepaper covers the project's mission, technical architecture, gameplay, governance model, SNS launch, token economy, roadmap, and SNS governance.

## 2. Overview of IClandlord

## 2.1 What is IClandlord?

IClandlord is a chain-wide card puzzle game that builds games on Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for IC to play a leading role in the gaming industry, and we hope to attract more developers to join Dfinity's ecosystem by exploring on-chain games.

Landlord is a popular card puzzle game with a large player base and continuous user activity. By fully porting the game to the Dfinity public chain, we can leverage Dfinity's decentralization, completely random number and 100% on-chain contract attributes to provide users with a fairer, safer and more transparent gaming experience. In addition, Landlord game also has strong operational cash flow ability, through the in-game payment mechanism, it can bring sustainable revenue for the project while attracting more users to participate in the game.

### 2.2 Objectives

Our goal is to allow more users to experience the fun of playing games on IC, through a completely open game platform, anyone can earn revenue from the game and trade props through the marketplace, users can earn token rewards through their own gaming skills, at the same time, we hope to explore more possibilities of building games on IC through Landlord! .

### 2.3 gameplay

### 2.3.1 Game Dealer Rules

A deck of 54 cards, one person has 17 cards, leaving 3 cards as the base card. Players cannot look at the base card until the landlord is determined.

Happy Landlord Calling

Calling cards are dealt in turn according to the order of cards dealt. When calling cards, you can choose to "call the landlord" or "not to call". If a player chooses to "call the Landlord", the call will end immediately and that player will be the Landlord; if they all "don't call", the cards will be re-distributed and the call will be resumed until someone calls the Landlord.

How to play Happy Landlord

### First player to call

1. The first player to call is randomly selected by the system. 2.

2. If a player chooses to "show his/her hand" before the call, the first player who chooses to show his/her hand will be given the first right to call. 3.

3. If a player chooses to "show his/her hand" before the call and none of the three players chooses to "call the landlord", the system chooses the first player to show his/her hand as the landlord.

### Landlords

1. After a player has called the landlord, each player has one and only one chance to grab the landlord\*\*. After a player chooses to grab the landlord, if no other player continues to grab the landlord, then the landlord's rights belong to the player who grabbed the landlord. 2.

2. If no player chooses to "rob the landlord", the landlord's rights belong to the player who "called the landlord". 3.

3. For each **Robber**, the game multiplier is \*2. 4.

4. Any player who has **didn't call the landlord** can't play "robbing the landlord".

### Instructions for playing with open cards

1. Open hand is to show all the cards in the hand for the game, which is mainly divided into three kinds: open hand start, deal open hand, and open hand. 2.

2. Starting with a Bright Card: Before a card is dealt, choose a bright card and keep it to start the game with a multiplier of \*5. 3.

3. Deal Bright Cards: Choose Bright Cards to play while the cards are being dealt, with game multipliers *4 and*3 depending on the number of cards dealt.

4. Bright Cards: A player may choose to play a Bright Card game after collecting three cards, with a multiplier of \*2. 5.

5. If more than one player chooses "Bright Cards" at the same time, the largest multiplier of Bright Cards will be counted.

### Doubling Play Instructions

1. After you have chosen to rob the landlord, the landlord will add a doubling option before he plays his hand. After the landlord takes the base card into his hand, the doubling function will appear, and the user can choose to double or not to double. However, in order to perform the doubling operation, the player must meet certain conditions. 2.

2. After the doubling or not doubling operation is completed within the time limit, the player must wait for other players to complete the relevant operation or until the time limit is reached, then the game will start with the landlord playing cards.

3. The score of the game after doubling is calculated as follows: multiplier _the relationship of beans per point_ the number of doubles by oneself *the number of doubles by the opponent, if there is a double, then*2, if there is no double, then \*1. 4.

4. The doubling condition is that the number of joy beans of the specified user exceeds the specified value of the room. 5.

5. The following are the rules: 1. If the doubling user is the landlord, all the players must have more than the specified value of the room. 2. If the doubling user is a farmer, all the players must have more than the specified value of the room. 3. If the doubling user is a farmer, all the players must have more than the specified value of the room. 4.

### Playing Instructions

Hand the landowner the three base cards and show them for all to see. The landowner plays first, then in counterclockwise order. When it's the user's turn to follow suit, the user can choose to "not play" or play a card that is larger than the previous player's. The game ends when a player finishes playing. The game ends when a player finishes playing.

Happy Landlord Deck

**Happy Landlord has 13 legal card suits that can be varied**.

- Rocket: i.e. Double King (Big King and Small King), the largest card.

- Bomb: Four cards of the same value (e.g. four 8s).

- Single: A single card, in order of size from 3 (smallest) to big monster (largest).

- Pair: Two cards of the same size, in order from 3 (smallest) to 2 (largest).

- Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same size.

- Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value + a single card or a pair.

- Single Straight: Five or more consecutive single cards. Double Straight: Three or more consecutive pairs of cards.

- Triple Straight: Two or more consecutive three-card hands.

- Airplane with Wings: Three straights + the same number of singles (or the same number of pairs).

- Four with two: four cards + two hands. (Note: Four with two is not a bomb).

The size of Happy Landlord cards

- Rocket is the largest and can play any other cards. Bombs are smaller than rockets and bigger than other cards.

- When all the cards are bombs, the size of the cards is determined by their value.

- Except for Rockets and Bombs, all other cards must be of the same suit and have the same total number of tiles.

- Single tiles are ranked according to their value: Maharajah > Minor King >2>A>K>Q>J>10>9>8>7>6>5>4>3, regardless of suit. Pairs and threes are compared according to their value.

- Straight tiles are compared according to the value of the largest tile.

- Aircraft with wings and four with two are compared according to the three straights and the four-card part of them, and the cards with them do not affect the size.

Determination of the winner of the Landlord card game

Landlord Card Game Determination

The game ends when either player finishes playing. If the landlord finishes playing first, the landlord wins, otherwise the other two players win.

Scoring Rules

Losing player: X×N+A

Winning player: X×N-A

Multiplier:

1. Each landlord \*2

2. Per Bomb\*2

3. Open cards \*2 to 5

4. Spring\*2

## 3. Economic Model

## 3.1 Game Chips

NUT = NnsDAO Utility Token

NUT is a 100% on-chain stable token, fully backed by USDT and USDC assets. Each USDC or USDT in the public treasury will be worth 1000 NUT providing stability and security to NUT holders, the overall supply of NUTs is theoretically unlimited, the circulating supply of NUTs is managed through multiple game minting and burning mechanisms to keep pace with demand.

**1 NUT=0.001 USDT/USDC**

The purpose of designing NUT as an in-game utility token is to give players a more stable expectation of their in-game assets and to better protect them, as well as to allow game tokens to circulate throughout the Nnsdao gaming ecosystem. NUT has the advantage of being a stablecoin in-game, while providing players with greater flexibility and the ability to transfer their assets from game to game.

### Minting and Destruction of NUT

The main minting and destruction mechanisms are as follows:

- - NUT minting mechanism

1. Income earned in-game

2. Income earned by inviting friends

3. Rewards from Twister.

4.Income from NUT pledges .

**NUT Burning Mechanism:**

1. Table fees from the game.

2. Props purchase and upgrade.

3.Rental of pets.

4. Purchase of VIP and special event props admission tickets.

6.Transaction fees for sending/receiving NUTs to/from other users.

### 3.2 Governance Tokens

LMT is IClandlord's governance token, with a total supply set to 1 billion. IClandlord's initial token allocation is intended to facilitate a fair and equitable distribution of LMT tokens among all stakeholders. At launch, the SNS DAO will be initialized with 1 billion IClandlord tokens.

LMT = IClandlord meta token

### 3.2.1 Proposed Distribution of SNS Genesis LMTs

SNS will be initialized with 1 billion LMT tokens and the proposed distribution of tokens is as follows:

Decentralized sales: 40%

Teams: 10%

Treasury: 37.5%

Airdrop: 1.5%

Consultants: 1%

Seed Round: 10%

**Decentralized Sale**

To promote fairness in the distribution of Game Governance tokens and raising SNS funds, 45% of the total supply (450 million LMT tokens) will be offered for sale. The sale will be configured with a maximum limit of 200,000 ICP and a minimum limit of 50,000 ICP.We expect Neuron Fund to provide 100,000 ICP and raise the remaining 100,000 ICP from decentralized sale participants.

In the SNS Launchpad, potential participants should deposit ICP tokens in the IClandlord DAO sale section. Once the sale is completed, the Decentralized Sale Participant will receive LMT tokens in proportion to the deposited pledge. For example, if the ICP they deposit is 1% of the total ICP deposited during the sale, the buyer will receive 1% of the LMT tokens sold.

Each participant will receive a basket of 5 equal neurons. The first neuron will be immediately allocated to the pledged LMT token (zero dissolution delay). The other 4 neurons will have 3, 6, 12 and 18 month dissolution delays respectively.

Each Neuron Fund participant will similarly receive their LMT pass in the form of a basket of 5 equivalent neurons with the same configuration.

**Founding R&D team**

IClandlord is a gaming project incubated by NnsDAO Labs, with 9 game-loving enthusiasts involved in the development, working since May 2023, 15% of the 1 billion tokens will be allocated to the founding team. 3 co-founders will receive 5% of the LMT passes in the form of a basket of 48 equivalent neurons. Each neuron will have a 3 month dissolution delay. Starting with the SNS sale, these neurons will be distributed in equal monthly installments over a 48 month period. The Genesis team will not receive any tokens at the SNS sale event, and all tokens will have a vesting period at that time.

If a token has a "vesting period", it cannot be accessed until the end of the cycle (this includes increased dissolution delays). This ensures that the founders cannot drag in investors and provide a continuous incentive for IClandlord to keep developing the game.

Due to the short dissolution delay of 3 months for these neurons, which cannot be increased, the founders' voting rights are gradually reduced to ensure governance is properly decentralized.

**Airdrops and Advisors**

IClandlord has been supported by a wide range of community contributors and advisors since its inception. At SNS Sale, Genesis community members received 1.5% of the total supply and advisors received 1%.

Each Genesis community member/advisor will receive a basket of tokens in the form of 24 equivalent neurons. Each neuron will have a 3 month dissolution delay. These neurons will be distributed to users in equal proportions within 12 months of the monthly SNS sale.

As with the neurons allocated to founders, these neurons will have a 3 month dissolution delay and cannot be changed for unvested neurons.

Genesis community contributors also include those users who participate in the game after the September 2023 announcement of the MVP version. Community users will be given an NFT, which they can will be able to claim LMT tokens in their respective wallets upon completion of the SNS sale in lieu of the NFTs issued to them while playing the game.

**LMT Treasury & Foundation**.

Upon completion of the Decentralized Sale, SNS will retain 37.5% of the LMT Token Treasury. Of this amount, 10.625% has been earmarked and will be distributed to the Non-Profit Foundation, which will continue to develop and expand the infrastructure of the IClandlord platform as well as expand into new games.

The Foundation will be established following the sale of LMT tokens by SNS. The LMT tokens allocated to the Foundation will be designated for the following:

1. rewards for current and future employees of the Foundation (~ 10.625%)

2. the Foundation's participation in the governance of the platform, 45% of the total allocation ( ~ 16.875)

3. reserved for future new game project development and activities (~ 10%)

The Foundation will receive a basket of tokens in the form of 12 equivalent neurons, with the first neuron payable immediately. Each neuron will have a 6 month dissolution delay. The remaining neurons will vest over the 22 months of the SNS Sale, with an equal number of neurons vesting every 6 months.

A significant portion of the treasury will be used to reward users and developers for their positive contributions to the ecosystem. In addition, it will be made available through SNS Suggestions for Community Bounties to compensate developers and contributors for their contributions to IClandlord.

In order to enable more users to become holders of LMT tokens, a proposal will be made shortly after the decentralized sale to transfer LMT and ICP to the decentralized exchanges of the IC ecosystem. For each DEX that implements AMM, DAO will make three proposals: the first is to transfer a specified number of LMT tokens and ICP to the DEX, and to partner with some DEXs that already have farms, and the second is to offer LMT rewards to allow users to participate in the liquidity pool.

Our plan is to list LMT to multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXe) after the SNS sale is over, then Coinbase, Binance, Gate, OKX and other top centralized exchanges to list LMT.

### 3.2.2 Effectiveness and Benefits

LMT is IClandlord's governance token, and is also managed and controlled through the SNS DAO, e.g. new features are added, game events are organized, and users can participate in the form of voting and planning for IClandlord's development.

Games: Players can earn LMT rewards through a variety of game activities, including rankings, tournaments, and other yet-to-be-developed gameplay.

Pet Rental: Players can rent pets in-game to be rewarded with Activity Points and earn LMT tokens.

NFT Trading: Players can earn LMT by selling in-game NFTs or props to other players on the Marketplace.

Community Airdrops: Early Airdrops are available to players or contributors who support IClandlord in marketing, content creation and community building.

IClandlord DAO: Users can earn table fees by playing the game after pledging their token.

### 3.3 SNS DAO Launch

The IClandlord SNS DAO will be officially launched after the smart contract canisters controlled by the founding team are transferred to the SNS DAO and placed under the full control of the DAO.The DAO will be set up in the form of an Initial Governance, Token Management, and Technical Configuration. Once made public, the initial configuration will be permanent until launch.

The initial configuration values for SNS are shown in the following table and can be changed after launch as proposed.

| Transaction fee in LMT tokens that must be paid for ledger transfers   | 0.0001  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Number of LMT tokens that a rejected proposal costs the proposer       | 140     |
| Minimum number of LMT tokens that can be staked in a neuron            | 90      |
| Maximum voting period for a proposal                                   | 5 days  |
| Proportion of voting power needed for a proposal to be accepted        | 2%      |
| Minimum neuron dissolve delay to vote                                  | 3 month |
| Maximum neuron dissolve delay                                          | 4 years |
| Maximum dissolve delay bonus                                           | 4 years |
| Maximum age for age bonus                                              | 2 year  |
| Maximum age bonus                                                      | 1.35x   |
| Percentage of total supply that will be generated annually for rewards | 2.7x    |

**SNS Decentralized Sale Configuration**

The decentralized sale will be configured with the values shown below.

**SNS Decentralized Sale Configuration**

The decentralized sale will be configured with the values shown below.

| The total number of LMT tokens to be sold                            | 450,000,000 (45%)          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The minimum ICP to be raised (otherwise sale fails and ICP returned) | 50,000                     |
| The maximum ICP to be raised                                         | 200,000                    |
| The ICP to come from the Community Fund                              | 100,000                    |
| End date of sale (unless maximum ICP raised sooner)                  | 15 Days from start of Sale |
| Minimum number of sale participants                                  | 300                        |
| Minimum ICP per buyer                                                | 5                          |
| Maximum ICP per buyer                                                | 5,000                      |

**Valuation range**

The reason to impose a maximum target is to give participants a minimum bound on the number of LMT tokens they will receive for their ICP investment. The lower bound of 0.05M ICP and the upper bound of 0.2M ICP for 45% of the tokens gives the LMT DAO an initial total valuation between 0.01M ICP and 0.04M ICP.

The value (in ICP) of LMT tokens upon launch is based upon how many ICP tokens are raised in the decentralization sale. The more ICP tokens that are exchanged for 450,000,000 LMT tokens, the higher the value of a single BOOM token. This is because the price of 1 LMT token equals the amount of ICP earned (between 50,000 and 200,000) divided by the number of LMT tokens sold (450,000,000).

1 LMT token would initially be worth between 0.000111 -> 0.000444 ICP. As shown below:

![lmt-icp-price](/public/lmt-token-price.png)

### 3.4 Governance and Distribution

In order to improve the reasonable distribution of the game and the fairness mechanism for players, IClandlord sells its tokens through decentralization, without private placement and seed rounds, and to a large extent, it brings as much as possible fair distribution to the game developers and contributors, which is very challenging to implement, such as making the proposal and voting fairer in governance, and at the same time, letting more communities participate in the governance and future development of the game through incentives. IClandlord DAO needs to attract and coordinate a wide range of talents who are passionate about games, and at the same time provide a certain reference value for every new game in the ICP ecosystem.

### 3.4.1 Maximizing Decentralization

A community of decentralized sales participants will hold the largest portion of SNS tokens allocated to SNS sales to date (45%).This large portion of the IClandlord DAO's initial token allocation from Genesis will play a key role in the success of the DAO by maximizing its decentralization. This is because the DAO's high degree of autonomy in its initial stages encourages active participation by community members, who will have a vested interest in the DAO's success and a sense of accomplishment. This will keep community members interested in actively contributing to the development of IClandlord's gameplay and exploring additional gameplay possibilities.

At its core, the IClandlord DAO is a fluid democracy where all stakeholders have the right to determine its direction. the IClandlord DAO is initially over 80% voting and is designed to prioritize the community's voice in governance decisions. We believe in collective wisdom over individuality, so from token creation and MVP game launch, with more than 80% of voting power in the hands of the community, stakeholders are empowered to actively participate in governance through a fluid democracy. This largely helps IClandlord DAO to develop in a positive way.

### 3.4.2 Likelihood of 51% attack

Theoretically, it is possible that the IClandlord SNS treasury could be the target of an attack. In fact, the DAO could be taken over by a single party that effectively steals the treasury. In a so-called 51% attack, a single party gains control of a majority of the votes and pushes for a vote on a proposal to transfer the entire treasury to itself.

One possible scenario is that an attacker purchases more than 50% of the LMT tokens in a decentralized sale and immediately raises the dissolution delay of all their neurons to a maximum of 2 years in an attempt to gain more than 50% of the SNS vote. If successful, they could force the transfer of development funds from the entire treasury to designated accounts through a proposal.

In addition to the extreme costs associated with such an attack, the Neuron Fund greatly mitigates this by purchasing a significant portion of the LMT tokens in the SNS sale. Doing so limits the percentage of voting power an attacker can gain.

This chart shows a scenario where an attacker manages to purchase 90% of the available tokens in a decentralized sale, which is already highly unlikely.

![lmt-vote-power](/public/init-vote.png)

If the attacker then increases the dissolution delay of all their neurons to the maximum dissolution delay of 2 years, the graph below shows how much voting power they would be able to gain. As the obtained data shows, the attacker still does not gain more than 51% of the voting power, only 45.9%.

![lmt-vote-dao-price](/public/vote-dao.png)

### 3.5 Tokenomics Model

You can [view the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NzXb3_rBv-i_Ryp7eE7_Z5Q75q77FMA1wkqizuKs2H8/edit?usp=sharing) we have used to model various aspects of the IClandlord DAO tokenomics which is also the source for the various charts in this document.

### 3.6 SBT Tokens

What are Soulbound Tokens?

Soulbound tokens (SBTs) are non-transferable tokens representing a person's identity using blockchain technology. This could include medical records, work history, and any type of information that makes up a person or entity. The wallets that hold or issue these records are called "Souls. The wallets that hold or issue these records are called "Souls."

People could have multiple wallets (or Souls) representing different parts of their lives. For example, someone could have a "Credentials Soul" for their work history and a "Soul" for their work history. For example, someone could have a "Credentials" Soul" for their work history and a "Medical Soul" for their health records. Souls and SBTs would allow people to Souls and SBTs would allow people to build a verifiable, digital Web3 reputation based on their past actions and experiences.

The logic behind soulbound originates from the popular online game World of Warcraft.

Players cannot sell or transfer soulbound items. Once picked up, soulbound items are forever "bound" to the player Once picked up, soulbound items are forever "bound" to the player's "soul."

Therefore, in order for your character to have a better reputation, you have no choice but to personally participate in the game and win, in IClandlord SBT is a special token, no matter whether a player wins or loses a hand, it will be recorded to the SBT, you can think of it as SBT is a kind of badge, the user in the whole game ecosystem to obtain the honor.

Users can also redeem SBT tokens in the mall by using the NUT, after obtaining the token, users can obtain the equivalent value of USDT or USDC by performing operations on the SBT token.

## 4. Game Guide

Gameplay and wallet connection, withdrawal and recharge modes of the game are described.

## 5. Gameplay

### 5.1 Sign-in and Daily Activities

Players can earn points by logging into Landlord and signing in every day, and if they complete the game, they can also earn the corresponding activity level, and in the future, users can get the right to receive airdrops through the corresponding points.

Prior to the launch of the SNS DAO, users earned LMT Points as a way to track your progress as an iclandlord tester. Technically, the number of LMT Points you can earn is unlimited, but there are limits to the number of LMT Points you can earn through interactions, games, events, etc. For example, by renting a game in a game, you can earn LMT Points by renting a game in a game. For example, the number of points you can earn by renting a pet in a game is capped at 100 points per week (the number of points you earn decreases if you don't continue until the Token is issued).

LMT Points are used to track your progress as a beta tester and contributor to the iclandlord network. They have no monetary value.

### 5.2 vip system

After purchasing the VIP system, players will get the corresponding rights and levels, please enter the game to check the corresponding rewards.

### 5.3 Pet Rental

Pet leasing is one of the ways for players to get rewards in the game. If players continue to lease pets, they will get the corresponding rights, and the maximum number of pets issued is 100000 pets.

Rules for leasing: 1.

1. Each player can only rent one pet.

2.The ownership of the pet always belongs to the platform, if the player stops leasing the pet, he/she will lose the corresponding rights.
