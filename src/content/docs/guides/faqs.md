## What is Internet Computer (ICP)?

Internet Computer (ICP) is a set of protocols that allow independent data centers around the world to band together and offer a decentralized alternative to the current centralized internet cloud providers. The ICP token is used for governance (holders can vote on the future of the network), to reward network participants for good behavior, and is used to pay fees for making transactions.

## What is SNS?

Service Nervous Systems (SNSs) are [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) that allow developers to hand over their dapps to decentralized, token-based governance systems. SNSs enable Web3 services to be owned and governed by their communities, evolving through proposals that respond to the desires, feedback, and voting of those communities. Each SNS DAO has its own utility token that community members can stake to claim governance rights or use to purchase services, and which can be used by the SNS to reward community contributions. SNS DAOs allow developers around the world to raise funds for their projects, drive viral growth, and provide users with a stake in the service, democratizing access to the tech economy.
